# Problem Statment
Problem statement

In recent years, Hotel and restaurant have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issue as result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.

The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are cancelled are those that are not. It is obvious that there are still significant number of reservations that have not been cancelled. There are still 37% of clients who cancelled their reservation, which has significant impact on the hotel’s earnings.

In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings.its possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.

The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rates for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

I have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of cancelled reservations are the largest in august. Whereas January is the month with most cancelled reservations.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are greatest and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.
The country with highest cancellation rate is Portugal.

Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% comes from groups. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and make reservations.

As seen before, reservations are cancelled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not cancelled. It clearly proves all the above analysis, that the higher price leads to higher cancellation.
